Applying sentiment analysis on Amazon's product reviews.

Product reviews are becoming more important with the evolution of traditional brick and mortar retail stores to online shopping. Consumers are posting reviews directly on product pages in real time. With the vast amount of consumer reviews, this creates an opportunity to see how the market reacts to a specific product.
We will be attempting to see if we can predict the sentiment of a product review using machine learning tools, particularly the Support Vector Machine.

The dataset I will be using is from www.kaggle.com.

I have also provided the direct link below if you wish to view the dataset I used to build my model:

I have downloaded the dataset and pushed along with the code in this repo.
You can unzip and use it.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

This was my third data analysis project using Python, and I look forward to contribute more to the community!



With love
